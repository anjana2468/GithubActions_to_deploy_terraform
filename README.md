Infrastructure setup using Githubactions to deploy terraform template
# Terraform AWS Infrastructure with GitHub Actions Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnet, internet gateway, security group, and EC2 instance. The Terraform state is managed using an S3 backend. This repository also integrates a GitHub Actions pipeline to automatically trigger Terraform operations such as initialization, planning, and destruction.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine (for local testing).
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with your AWS credentials.
- A GitHub repository to store your Terraform code.
- A GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configured to automatically trigger Terraform operations.

- `src/main.tf`: Contains additional Terraform configurations (e.g., EC2 instance, VPC, subnet, etc.).
- `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`: GitHub Actions pipeline file to automatically trigger Terraform operations.

# AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

This project provisions a basic AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It includes:
- A custom VPC
- A public subnet
- An internet gateway
- A route table with internet access
- A security group allowing SSH and HTTP
- An EC2 instance in the public subnet

## ðŸ§± Resources Created

- **VPC**: Custom VPC with CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`
- **Subnet**: Public subnet in `us-west-2a` (`10.0.1.0/24`)
- **Internet Gateway**: For internet access
- **Route Table**: Routes `0.0.0.0/0` to the IGW
- **Security Group**: Allows:
  - SSH (port 22)
  - HTTP (port 80)
- **EC2 Instance**: Amazon Linux 2 AMI (`t2.micro`)

How to use:

1. ## Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/anjana2468/GithubActions_to_deploy_terraform.git
cd GithubActions_to_deploy_terraform
```
2. Initialize Terraform
```
terraform init
```
4. Plan Infrastructure
```
terraform plan
```
6. Apply Infrastructure
```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

8. (Optional) Destroy Infrastructure
```
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
What the Workflow Does

The `terraform.yml` workflow (inside .github/workflows/) is triggered when you push changes to the main branch. Here's what each step does:

### Step	                      ### Purpose
- `Checkout`	                   Pulls your code into the GitHub runner
  
- `Setup`                        Terraform	Installs Terraform on the GitHub runner
- `Terraform Init`	             Initializes Terraform and configures the backend (S3, in this case)
- `Terraform Plan`	             Shows what will be created/changed/destroyed before applying
- (Optional) `Apply`	           Actually creates/updates infrastructure (commented out for safety)
- (Optional) `Destroy`           Deletes all infrastructure (use cautiously!)

##Required Secrets
### Secret Name	                ### Purpose
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`	               Identifies the IAM user or role
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`            Secret key that works with the access key to authorize actions
